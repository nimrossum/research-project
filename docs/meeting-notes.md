Agenda:

- In a bit of a rut, project feels underwhelming and I don't feel like I am making progress
- Feels like there is a lot of trial and error, mostly error, which is not really interesting to write about
- Still not convinced whether this is a useful metric to compute, at least with the current idea
- Not sure what to focus on at this point
- Christian just send a mail about a fast python version he wrote for calculating ncd relative to final revision

Questions about report:

- [ ] How many pages should I write?
- [ ] What do you expect in the report


## 11/03/2024 - Jonas / Mircea

To do
- [ ] Find subjectively "important" commits and compare with the "jump in distance"
- [ ] Find 20 commits that are "important", 20 commits that are "boring"
  - [ ] Equally distributed throughout the lifetime of the project
  - [ ] Precision: Find outliers, do they make sense?
  - [ ] Recall: Define our own subjective i
- [ ] Run the method
- [ ] Compare with alternatives
- [ ] Write about the method - Compression in a Google Doc
  - [ ] In this mini experiment, we tried to find ....
  - [ ] We used this code and this is what we found out
- [ ] Find big "jumps in distance" and see if those commits seem important - be aware of bias
- [ ] A lot of boring code / formatting -> does that lead to a
