This file is completely different and writes about some other stuff.

Here is some python code to read an image and mask out blue pixels:

```python
import os

from PIL import Image

# Load the image
image_path = os.path.join('images', 'example.png')
image = Image.open(image_path)

# Create a mask for blue pixels
mask = image.split()[2].point(lambda p: p > 150 and 255)

# Save the mask
mask_path = os.path.join('images', 'mask.png')
mask.save(mask_path)
```
